For well over a year now I've been slowly picking around the edges of a massive undertaking - design and code, in Python, a general-purpose MUD engine. I had lofty ambitions. The design was to emphasize security from the ground up. The code would be portable, as useful to a middle school student running it off the back of his third-hand laptop as to a professional game-dev trying to use it to make a living.

Unfortunately, I've gotten into it for the wrong reasons. I've said from the outset I have no actual interest in game development. Beyond being a storyteller at heart, I don't have the right mindset. The problems of gaming - especially in such an old style as a MUD - are solved. There's nothing interesting to do there from a coder's perspective.

So I'm hanging it up. Tarnished Tale's extant source code and development notes are still available [on github](https://www.github.com/ZAdamMac/Tarnished-Tale). But I'm no longer actively developing it. Like a gardener, I've had to pull out some perfectly adequate plants to let the truly interesting ones flourish. In order to give Tapestry the attention it's really starting to need, and have a life outside of pycharm, *and* work on learning a lower-level language and my hardware projects, something as big and complex as a game engine needs to be set aside.

That doesn't mean I'm no longer open to finding other developers to help me work on it. But since the MUD space is small and the number of engines available is large, I think I'm more likely to just start putting a game together on someone else's engine, at this point.
