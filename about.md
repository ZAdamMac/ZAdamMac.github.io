I'm Zachary Adam-MacEwen, an amateur python wrangler (in two senses), self-taught security nerd, professional chef and all-around nerd operating out of Eastern Canada. I've established this page so that I can get a bit more technical in my explanations of Tapestry and TarnishedTail (a home-rolled MUD client in early development), as well as other projects or vaguely-related topics I might refer to.

Your ongoing support is appreciated. If you're bored waiting for these infrequent updates you might also check out more of my infrequent updates [here](https://www.psavlabs.com)
