Those of you who are following my twitter have probably noticed me dropping hints about having a new project, and I'm happy to say that those hints are actually relevant. I do have a new project - on the back burner while I tidy up a few details on some ongoing, older projects, but one that I think will (productively) use up quite a bit more time and attention as I progress out of the preliminary research stage and into actual development.

**Project Clair** aims to create... something. I'm not going to tell you what, precisely, yet, until I have a working unit closer to completion. Clair will be my first hardware hacking project - beyond the odd kludge and the Gliesse Build, anyway.

Clair's progress will involve microcontroller programming, and learning how to integrate a microcontroller with switches, battery, display, and memory components. If we get through development it'll also be my first foray into PCB design and production, and perhaps my first commercial project to market under the PSLabs moniker.

Plus, it falls into a category I think everyone in every fandom loves: Swag. So I will give you one more hint:

Project Clair is *not* just another Wifi Sniffer Badge.
