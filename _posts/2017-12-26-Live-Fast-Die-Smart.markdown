While I've always been a fairly technical person (I can't remember the first time I used a computer, for example), 2017 is probably best ddescribed as the year I became Technical. This was the year I went from goofing around with simple LUA scripts to building fairly complicated bits of software, the year I started in on hardware development, and in general the year that I went from merely having a passing interest in technology and security to being the year I went into practice.

This is not merely because this is the same year I taught myself Python. In a very real sense I now work in the tech industry, though I freely admit I'm not working in security. I now work as a computer service technician, repairing donor machines and getting them ready to be used by my province's school system. It's a short-term contract, but one I hope provides the proverbial foot in the door.

This is also the first time I've taken on a full-scale development project - in fact, I've taken on two. While I wouldn't call them ultra-professional or anything, I hope that both Tarnished Tale and Tapestry start resembling something I can be proud of in the near future.
